class Dropout(nn.Module):
    r"""
    As from the upstream pytorch :

    During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor
    with probability `p` using samples from a Bernouilli distribution. Each
    channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call.

    Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of $\frac{1}{1-p}$ during
    training. This means that during evaluation the module simply computes an
    identity function.

    Note:
        As for now, with torch 2.1.0 torch.nn.Dropout cannot be applied on
        complex valued tensors. However, our implementation relies on the torch
        implementation by dropout out a tensor of ones used as a mask on the
        input.

    Arguments:
        p: probability of an element to be zeroed.
