# Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNN) - Pytorch

[![docs](https://github.com/jeremyfix/torchcvnn/actions/workflows/doc.yml/badge.svg)](https://jeremyfix.github.io/torchcvnn/) ![pytest](https://github.com/jeremyfix/torchcvnn/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

This is a library that uses [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) as a back-end for complex valued neural networks.

It was initially developed by Victor Dhédin and Jérémie Levi during their third year project at CentraleSupélec. 

## Installation

To install the library, it is simple as :

```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/jeremyfix/torchcvnn.git
```
